# Custom Hook Return Values

## Overview

In the previous example of the `useCount` hook, we saw it was possible to have a
custom hook return some values which we can use in our components:

```js
function useCount(initialCount) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  function increment() {
    setCount((count) => count + 1);
  }

  function decrement() {
    setCount((count) => count - 1);
  }

  return { count, increment, decrement };
}
```

Let's get some practice extracting another custom hook that has a return value,
this time with a bit more complexity.

## Exercise

In the starter code for this exercise, we've got a component that searches for a
Pokemon using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) based on a query entered by
a user.

Your job is to extract the logic for fetching the Pokemon, and the state
associated with that Pokemon, to a separate hook.

Make sure that your hook returns some data, and that you're able to use that
data within the component! The tests for this exercise expect the `usePokemon`
hook to return an object with a key of `data` and a value of the Pokemon. For
example:

```js
function useTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date());

  // set up an interval in a useEffect, etc.

  // return an object
  return {
    data: time,
  };
}
```

Then, I can simply call the hook in my component and destructure the object to
get back its value:

```js
function App() {
  const { data } = useTime();
}
```

### Extra Credit

When working with `fetch` and (Promise-related code in general), there are a few
different states our code can be in:

- _pending_: waiting for data from the API
- _fulfilled_: data has been retrieved successfully
- _rejected_: an error occurred (something went wrong!)

It's often useful to show our users an indication of these different states, so
they are aware that our app is working on something that might take some amount
of time in the background.

If we want access to these states in our component so that we can show our user,
we'll need to account for those in our hook as well.

Update your `usePokemon` hook so that it returns an object with the following
properties:

- `data`: an _object_ containing the response returned from the API
  - it should be set to `null` if you don't have a response yet
- `status`: a _string_ indicating if the request is:
  - `idle` (no request has been made)
  - `pending` (request made, waiting for response)
  - `fulfilled` (response success), or
  - `rejected` (response failed)
- `errors`: an _array_ of any error messages
  - it should be set to `null` if you don't have any errors

If you want to get the errors from the API, you'll need to modify your fetch
request:

```js
fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${query}`)
  .then((r) => {
    if (r.ok) {
      return r.json();
    } else {
      return r.text().then((err) => {
        throw err;
      });
    }
  })
  .then((data) => {
    // set data in state
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // set error in state
  });
```
